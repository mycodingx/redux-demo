# Reducers

- Specify how the app's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
- Actions only describe what happened, but reducers describe how the application state changes.
- Reducers are the functions that accepts state and action as arguments, and return the next state of the application.

```
(previousState, action) => newState
```
